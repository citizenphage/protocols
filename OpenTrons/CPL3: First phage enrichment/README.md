# CPL3: First phage enrichment.

The 1ml pools of sterilised sample in the deep well plate are enriched for presence of phages. Firstly, 400ul of the concentrated 4.4xLB broth is added to each well. Then, 75ul of host bacteria cultured to exponential growth phase (0.6 OD at 600nm) is added to each well.
