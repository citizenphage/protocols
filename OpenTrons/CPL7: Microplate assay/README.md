# CPL7: Microplate assay.

This protocol is part of the liquid-based approach to phage isolation. It is used alongside accompanying R code, and protocol CPL8: Recovery of phage positive wells. We use the Tecan plate reader to measure optical density in each well over time to measure potential bacterial killing by phages.
