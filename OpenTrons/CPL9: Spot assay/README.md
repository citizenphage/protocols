# CPL9: Spot assay
Highly customisable protocol to spot wells from a 96-well microplate onto an omnitray. The user defined variables allow for a classic spot assay, with the option to use checkerboard-style alternate spotting. The capacity for spotting serial-dilutions is also provided, reducing tip usage. Note: the omnitray should contain 40ml bottom agar, with 4.5ml top agar and 1.5ml host culture poured above.
